> Application where the user can organize his tasks/event in the calendary.

### Access the application on your browser: (https://weather-app-plum-nine.vercel.app/)

## 💻 How it works

To access the calendar app the user needs to sign in or create an accout if he doesn't has one. After logged, the user can navigate between the months of the year or of the last/next years, and create some task. There is a task page where contains all of tasks of that user. It's possible to edit the task informations and delete it either.

## 💻 How it was made

For the front-end, I've used React and Typescript to create the interface and make all of the interactions with user's actions and with back-end services.  
For the back-end, it was used Node.js and TypeScript to grab information from front-end, make the necessary processes and connect to database (PostgreSQL).  
In the part of authentication it was used jwt for the exchanges of informations between client and server.
